# 🐩 poodle-pizza-calculator 🐩

A small demo of global state using Context in React.

The goal is to build a simple pizza ordering app where you can choose a pizza to add to your order and see the total cost of all pizzas added.

We want some kind of edit and delete functionality.

The app should be able to handle an order of many different pizzas (not just one). This order should be stored in a global state.
